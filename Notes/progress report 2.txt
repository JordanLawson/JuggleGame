The game has progressed well over the past week and I have been able to implement most aspects of game play I wanted.  Certain areas of the game remain under developed with the main menu being ugly and the complete lack of sound being the two most notable.  There is also a problem with progression in the game as some levels require ideas or the use of items that aren't introduced until later on.  I strongly considered creating a html5 version of the game since the porting look to be very direct from the windows version, however I have encountered at least one glitch which prevents the game from being completable and am yet to resolve it.
I am still pushing for completion by end of day July 22 so here I will list out the actions I plan on taking over the next few days.

Fix problem with the yoodoo doll in html5 version.
Further improvements and testing of the html5 version.
Introduce basic sound effects for movement and weapons.
Add a music back track.
Rearrange worlds and levels and introduce a new world for misfit levels.
